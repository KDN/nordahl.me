# Needle - Short movie

Note: This movie was made as a part of my abroad studies at Queensland University of Technology. 

The movie is written, directed, captured and edited by me. The idea of the movie is to affect the viewer to feel the disgust of living in a lonely environment where your only human interaction happens around the drugs.

The task was to a short movie with only a cut-edit. Since the film was going to be shoot outdoors I didn't have a controlled environment to achieve the dark look. To active the desired effect I then had to have full control over the camera and push both the iris and the build in electronics to the limit.
